# Given an m x n binary matrix filled with 0's and 1's, find the largest square containing only 1's and return its area.

 

# Example 1:


# Input: matrix = [["1","0","1","0","0"],["1","0","1","1","1"],["1","1","1","1","1"],["1","0","0","1","0"]]
# Output: 4
# Example 2:


# Input: matrix = [["0","1"],["1","0"]]
# Output: 1
# Example 3:

# Input: matrix = [["0"]]
# Output: 0
 

# Constraints:

# m == matrix.length
# n == matrix[i].length
# 1 <= m, n <= 300
# matrix[i][j] is '0' or '1'.
