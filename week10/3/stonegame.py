# Alice and Bob play a game with a row of stones, where each stone has a value given in the array `stones`.
# Players take turns removing any stone from the array, starting with Alice. 
# The game has a losing condition: if the sum of all values of removed stones becomes divisible by 3, 
# the player who just made the move loses. If no stones remain and it is Alice's turn, Bob wins automatically.
# Both players play optimally, meaning they make moves that maximize their chances of winning.
# The function returns `True` if Alice can win and `False` if Bob wins.

        Alice's winning condition (GPT):
        To win, Alice needs to create a situation where Bob cannot avoid making the sum divisible by 3.
        The way Alice and Bob play optimally ensures that they try to delay this losing condition as long as possible.
        If there are significantly more type-1 or type-2 stones (i.e., a large imbalance),
        Alice can control the game to force Bob into an unfavorable position.
        The significant imbalance gives Alice the flexibility to dictate the flow of the game
        and force Bob into a position where he cannot avoid making the sum divisible by 3.
